My work in this experiment has been very dificult but very interesting. After having installed what is required in the exercise, proceed to develop the two experiments.

Experiment 1: Application using JPA. In this experiment the purpose was to create a better understanding of how we can apply these tools i couldnt to do the experiment succesfully whe i did the tutorial. I couldnt get to inspect the database and i tried for hours to do it. this is the link to my falied experiment. i did was supose the tutorial asf for but still i dad isues that was dificult to me resolve, since the time for me was short and i decided to deliver the experiment. I think my problem was i used intelij som min IDEA and if i had used eclipse maybe i could get a better result. this is the link to the experiment 1 part1 and part 2 https://github.com/Zuleta84/DAT250-exp-1-part2-de.vogella.jpa.eclipselink.git https://github.com/Zuleta84/de.vogella.jpa.simple.git
